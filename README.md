MOTION REX

ABSTRACT:
The game “MotionRex” is a unique single player version of the popular Chrome extension T-rex Runner.This game works by utilizing IR sensor(P103 T020)  for the motion of Dino. Upon the signal of IR sensor by user the dino jumps over the obstacle which is cacti. There is also an FPGA button which converts the dino to duck position.
The game involves a running dino that can jump to avoid colliding with the obstacle when the IR sensor is triggered by the user. The obstacles are the cacti that will come in the way of dino when the dino is in running state. This game is inspired from google chrome extension Trex runner but it has its own unique features that makes it different. This is created by using FPGA BASYS3 BOARD and by using Vrilog language. The IR sensor used in this project is IR-SENSOR(P103 T020).
